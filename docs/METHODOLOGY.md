## Methodology

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Identify the purpose and scope of the chatbot.
   - Define the target audience and expected functionalities.

2. **Designing Patterns and Responses**:
   - Define a set of patterns and corresponding responses for the chatbot.
   - Use regular expressions to match user inputs and trigger specific responses.

3. **Setting Up the Development Environment**:
   - Install Python and NLTK library.
   - Set up a development environment for coding (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).

4. **Implementing the Chatbot Logic**:
   - Write Python code to implement the chatbot logic.
   - Define pattern-response pairs and preprocess user inputs using NLTK.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the chatbot by interacting with it using various inputs.
   - Validate that it responds correctly to different patterns and handles edge cases.

6. **Iterative Development**:
   - Iterate on the chatbot design based on feedback and testing results.
   - Refine patterns, add new responses, and improve the user experience.

7. **Documentation and Deployment**:
   - Document the chatbot's functionality, usage instructions, and dependencies.
   - Deploy the chatbot to the desired platform or environment.

8. **Maintenance and Updates**:
   - Monitor the chatbot's performance and gather user feedback.
   - Make necessary updates and improvements over time.
