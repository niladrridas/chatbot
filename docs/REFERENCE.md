# Pattern Matching Chatbot

## About

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot implemented using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It falls under the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The chatbot uses pattern matching to respond to user inputs. Pattern matching is a basic concept in computer science where sequences of characters are checked to see if they match a certain pattern. In this case, regular expressions (regex) are used to define the patterns.

### Dynamics

The Dynamics section of this project focuses on the behavior and interactions of the chatbot. It encompasses the various patterns and responses that the chatbot is programmed to recognize and generate. By understanding the dynamics of the chatbot, developers can fine-tune its performance and enhance the user experience.

In this section, we will explore the different types of questions and statements that the chatbot can respond to. These include introductions, greetings, inquiries about its name, expressions of emotions, well-being, inquiries about its age, weather-related queries, sports and games, current world leaders, and the option to quit the chat.

By carefully defining and implementing these dynamics, the chatbot can engage in meaningful conversations and provide relevant and helpful responses to users. It is important to note that the chatbot's responses are based on predefined patterns and rules, utilizing regular expressions (regex) to match user inputs.

Developers can further customize and expand the dynamics of the chatbot by modifying the patterns and responses defined in the code. This flexibility allows for the creation of a chatbot that is tailored to specific use cases and requirements.

Overall, understanding and managing the dynamics of the chatbot is crucial for creating an effective and engaging conversational experience for users. By continuously refining and optimizing these dynamics, developers can ensure that the chatbot delivers accurate and helpful responses, enhancing its overall performance and user satisfaction.

**The chatbot can respond to the following types of questions or statements:**

- Introduction: If you say "my name is [your name]", it will respond with "Hello [your name], How are you today ?".

- Greetings: If you say "hi", "hey", or "hello", it will respond with "Hello" or "Hey there".

- Asking its name: If you ask "what is your name ?", it will respond with "I'm a bot. I'm called Part-time Bot."

- Expressing emotions: If you say something like "I'm so happy today" or "I'm really glad to see you", it will respond with "That's great to hear" or "[Your statement]? That's good!"

- Doing good: If you say "I'm doing good", it will respond with "Nice to hear that" or "Alright, great !"

- Asking its age: If you ask something like "What's your age?", it will respond with "I'm a bot, I don't have an age"

- Asking about the weather: If you ask "what is the weather in [place]?", it will respond with "I'm sorry, I cannot provide weather information as I don't have access to the internet."

- Asking about sports or games: If you ask something like "Do you like sports?" or "Can you play a game?", it will respond with "I'm a bot, I don't have the ability to play or watch sports/games."

- Asking about current world leaders: If you ask "who is the president of [country]?" or "who is the prime minister of [country]?", it will respond with "I'm sorry, I cannot provide current world information as I don't have access to the internet."

- Quitting the chat: If you say "quit", it will respond with "Bye. It was nice talking to you. See you soon :)"
